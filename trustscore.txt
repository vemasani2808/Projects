collect only the cascades which have the specific website id to which we are calculating the trust score and engagement score for..

Trust Score : Calculate the sum of the base score and bonus score , base score is 0.1 for all of the websites

1)bonus score is classified as :

(i)count the number of times the website appears across all the cascades as a source one ,that means the first node in a cascade
(ii)for each of the cascade individually ,calculate the mid time stamp, that is the last time stamp in a cascade + first time stamp in a cascade /2, then check if the website
we are calculating is at or before the mid timestamp and after the source node, if so then increment mid count by +1

now we have the appearnces as the source node across all the cascades and also the mid count 

now bonus score is 0.8* appearances as source node + 0.2* midcount 


totally trust score is base score+bonus score now
